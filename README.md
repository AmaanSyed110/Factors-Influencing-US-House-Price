# Factors-Influencing-US-House-Price
## Description


The "Factors Influencing US House Prices" project aims to develop a robust predictive model to identify and analyze the key factors that affect housing prices in the United States. By leveraging a comprehensive dataset, we seek to understand the relationships between various economic and demographic variables and their impact on the housing market.

## Dataset:
The dataset includes the following columns:
- CSUSHPISA: US Housing Price Index (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CSUSHPISA)
- Per_Capita_GDP: Per Capita Gross Domestic Product (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/A939RX0Q048SBEA)
- Working_Population: Number of people in the working-age population 
- Houses: Number of houses available
- CPI: Consumer Price Index
- UNRATE: Unemployment Rate (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE)
- Cons_Materials: Construction Materials Cost
- FEDFUNDS: Federal Funds Rate (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS)
- Num_Households: Number of Households
- Income: Average Income
- Subsidy: Housing Subsidies
- old_percent: Percentage of the population that is elderly

## Expected Outcome
By the end of this project, we expect to have a highly accurate model that not only predicts US housing prices with a high degree of precision but also provides valuable insights into the economic and demographic factors that influence these prices. This information can be crucial for policymakers, real estate investors, and economic analysts in making informed decisions.
